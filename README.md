## Introduction

This project demonstrates my practical ability to set up and configure a Linux operating system—Ubuntu—within a virtualized environment. The task involved downloading the appropriate ISO, setting up a Virtual Machine (VM) using Oracle VM VirtualBox, configuring system resources, and successfully installing and running Ubuntu OS. This project serves as foundational proof of my proficiency in system setup, virtualization, and Linux basics.

## Objectives

- To demonstrate the process of downloading and installing a Linux distribution (Ubuntu) on a virtual machine.
- To develop hands-on experience with virtualization software (Oracle VM VirtualBox).
- To understand and configure virtual hardware resources including RAM, storage, and networking.
- To verify successful installation and perform basic post-installation checks.
